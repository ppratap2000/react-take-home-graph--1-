Here is a take-home assignment for creating a parent-child graph in React where one child can have multiple parents and the input is given in JSON format:

Task:

* Create a React application that displays a parent-child graph based on the input JSON data.
* The input JSON data will contain an array of objects, where each object represents a node in the graph.
* Each node object will have a unique id property and a parentIds property, which is an array of the ids of the node's parents.
* The graph should be rendered using a tree-like structure, with each parent node having multiple child nodes.
* The graph should be able to handle multiple levels of nesting, and should be able to display nodes that have multiple   parents.


Steps:

* Create a new component called Node that will be used to render each node in the graph.
* In the Node component, create a function that takes in the input JSON data and maps through the array of objects to create an array of Node components.
* In the Node component, create a function that recursively renders the child nodes of each parent node.
* In the Node component, create a function that checks whether each node has multiple parents, and if so, renders them accordingly.
* In the App component, import the JSON data and pass it as a prop to the Node component.
* In the App component, render the Node component and pass in the input JSON data as a prop.
* Verify that the graph is rendered correctly and that each node is displayed according to its parent-child relationship.
* Unit test cases are mandatory.

Additional features:
* Add a feature to highlight the selected node and its connections when clicked
* Add a feature to filter the graph based on certain criteria
* Add a feature to add new nodes and edges to the graph
* Add custom hook in the form validation of adding to new child modal


Sample JSON:

```json
[  {    "id": 1,    "name": "Parent A",    "parentIds": []
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Child A",
    "parentIds": [1]
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Child B",
    "parentIds": [1]
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Child C",
    "parentIds": [2,3]
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Child D",
    "parentIds": [2,3]
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Parent B",
    "parentIds": []
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Child E",
    "parentIds": [6]
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Child F",
    "parentIds": [6]
  }
]
```

Sample Graph would look like:
```
Parent A
  |
  |_____Child A
  |     |
  |     |_____Child C
  |     |
  |     |_____Child D
  |
  |_____Child B
        |
        |_____Child C
        |
        |_____Child D
Parent B
  |
  |_____Child E
  |
  |_____Child F
  
```
